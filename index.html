      <section class="card" id="css-section">
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
              <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>              <li></li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
              <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head section. <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" /></li>
              <li>Rather than repeating a rule combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>

          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>to declare a variable, use keyword var, then a name, then = data we want stored. for example, var shape = "circle";</li>
          <li>console.log(argument) outputs the argument value to the web console</li>
